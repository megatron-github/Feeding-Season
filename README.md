# Feeding_Season
A program about genetic and evolution

Project Feeding Season was inspired by Coding Train's Coding Challenge: Evolutionary Steering Force (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flxOkx0yLrY). Feeding Season used Node.JS and p5.js libraries to display the concept of Steering Force and Evolution. The goal is to create a system that resided by autonomous agents. The agents in the system have the abilities to track and consume food, and avoid poison that are founded in the system. The efficiency of tracking food and avoiding poison of each agent is randomly assigned. Thus, the program create diversed environment, where autonomous agents display different behaviors. The program display the system by opening the user's default web browser. Each autonomous must consume food to stay alive, and avoid poison to stay away from health damages. The agents are also able to clone themselves, in which the clone might carry similar characteristics of its parent. In other to clone itself, the autonomous must stay alive for a long time. Such agent must has the ideal efficiency in tracking food and avoiding poision.
